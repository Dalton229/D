So this is the mission that we have we're working with stigma 17 basically we have to work from sigma 17 if we going to be in sigma 17 for a while you know why yes or no because if we're not in nothing mode and I'm single zombie mode we're going to have to be in the sigma 17 mode because look at the only reason why we're not going to not want to be out of there is because we'll have to work with all the rescue bots because if you're working out of rescue bots guess what from sigma 17 they help us so basically we have Chase Boulder blades heatwave it's aka leader for the mission
